        <h1>Jar Jar Binks Theory</h1>

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Things to Consider</h5>
            Jar Jar was an inhabitant of the planet of Naboo. As was Chancellor Palpatine. Unlike any non-force user in this series, Jar Jar Binks has the ability to leap dozens of feet in the air and stick landings from a story or two above like a gymnast. His fight in Episode 1 along his fellow gungans, he literally takes out 7 droids using the one grabbing his leg and exhibits the stylings of the "Drunken Fist" martial arts. Bumbling oaf or pure genius? Hard to say considering George Lucas planned to name the 2nd movie "The Adventure of Jar Jar Binks" before his idea was scrapped.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="media my-4">
        <img src="img/48x48.svg" class="mr-3" alt="...">
        <div class="media-body">
            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Allusion or Illusion?</h5>
        Episode 1 was known as "The Phantom Menace" and many speculated whom this "Phantom Menace" was. Many felt it was Maul, but that is too obvious. Even if he resembled a phantom, he was a clear and apparent menace. Or Anakin as he was discovered in this movie, but consider that Jar Jar may be the Phantom Menace. Think back to all of the scenes you have seen him in, Binks escapes death regularly and from insurmountable odds at time. Including from his stints in the CLone Wars series where he faced greater odds than most Jedi and always found his way out.

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Connecting It All</h5>
            Jar Jar is constantly around Anakin when the Chancellor is not. Assuming their working together, this would mean they always have eyes on their future prize in Skywalker. Beyond the other conspicuous examples listed, the idea he is Darth Plageus is not far off. Plageus (as we know from the theater scene with Anakin and Palpatine) was Sidious' master. The chancellor mentioned the ability to defy death was a trait of him. Imagine he defied death, or staged such death, while reincarnating himself as Jar Jar Binks? Why else would Lucas bring such a vital character in to not have force abilities? To be the ultimate mastermind decoying as the goof of the group? Many stories use this line of development for villains to engage in a massive plot twist. There were subtle clues all along, this met all those criteria. And force-user or not, Binks is the lynch pin in the Sith revolution via Order 66. It was Jar Jar Binks who convinced the entire galactic senate to give all power to the Chancellor. To me this (coupled with Lucasfilm's cancelled storyboard) is the most damning evidence of this theory's validity, as how could one believe a bumbling oaf, Gungan outcast could go from left for dead... to influencing all of existence in this fictional world? Seems orchestrated to me.
