        For a decade or two now, the prime focus of game development between Sony and Microsoft was realistic high-definition visuals for what were 9/10 times FPS or sports games. Nintendo, however, has always looked to push the boundaries of what gaming can become. Instead of focusing on developing sports titles, first-person shooters, and super high-def adventure games with only 4 hours of storyline, Nintendo decided to let Microsoft and Sony duke it out over those niches. Meanwhile, Nintendo continued to advance the potential of proven target niches. Why make the adventure game super hi-def and sacrifice the quality and playability of the content itself, when a slightly less defined, cartoon-like model for character design has equal if not greater success? Video games were made to escape reality and explore the world created by developers. Sony and Microsoft's change in focus has put them in a predicament. They rely on the big-name titles to drive the funding of all other items of concern, which makes them slaves to the constant grind of games that are expected to release annually. Nintendo allows it's developers to build upon their creativity instead of looking at a mock up of a face and being told to match the best they can. Which they will update again each and every year. If I were a game developer, I would want to push the boundaries. Create something new, not recreate reality inside of a mechanism designed to help flee it. From the motion controls of the Wii, to the floaty mechanics of the main exclusive games, to the new Mario Kart in-home setup! Nintendo is constantly pushing the boundaries.
