To begin, create a new branch using git checkout - b branch-name-here
*No need to put quotations around branch name*

Make changes to existing file or create new file.
*This way you have changes to upload to the new branch that are different from the master.*

Use git add and git commit -m"" as usual.
When you are on final step instead of git push origin master switch "master" for "branch-name-here"
*This practice allows you to upload the code for review without affecting a live site or the master project*

At this point, go to GitHub.
You can do so through your browser, or there should be a link after you push to the new branch in the subsequent terminal code.
The link will take you to your branches page on GitHub.
Once there, make sure you see the status "Able to Merge" at top of page.
Then, you will be able to select "Create Pull Request".
On the ensuing page, there is a message that says "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch".
If you see this message, go ahead and click "Merge Pull Request"
Next, select "Confirm Merge" to finalize.

Return to IntelliJ (or terminal you are using) and use git checkout master
Follow that with git pull origin master and the files should now be synced locally.
